# Maze
I used SMFL for the graphical interface so you MUST have it, version 2.5 and above\
-> https://www.sfml-dev.org/download-fr.php \
-> or install package `sfml`
# Keybinds
You can move using `Z Q S D` because I have an azerty keyboard, mark cells using `E` and quit with `ESC`
# Other
You can change the size of the maze by modifying the line `maze m({size});` in the file `src/graphical_main.cpp`
